# DanceWithSense

Hello all.

I have tried to merge the two versions of the app.  They are not quite working together yet though.  There is a problem currently in the Operations.java file where it is looking for a resouce at r.id.tv and it can't find the tv bit, and I don't know where to point it.  Hopefully Andy will know.
I have only uploaded the files I have physically changed myself.  I'm not sure if that is the best way to do this.
Once we have convinced the darned thing to compile I will start trying to get them to work together.
